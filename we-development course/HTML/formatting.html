    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      <em
        >Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
        <strong> <sub>1500</sub></strong
        >s</em
      >, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
      a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
      the leap into <ins>electronic typesetting</ins>, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the <sup>1960s</sup> with the release of
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
      <del>more recently</del> with desktop publishing software like
      <mark>Aldus PageMaker</mark> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
